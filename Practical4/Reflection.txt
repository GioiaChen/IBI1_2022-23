In this week's practical, I learned how to use cygwin to write some files and modified them.
I also learned how to use github as a platform to upload my codes.
I met some challenges, like figuring out the steps of committing the files to github.
Since it's the first time that I have ever been exposed to cygwin and github, it will still take me some time to get familiar with the codes and operations.
